# PCC-MATE-ROV-ROVER
**Main branch** of the Pasadena City College MATE ROV Rover Repository.

Push all untested code the `develop` branch. Only merge code into the main branch once it has been thoroughly tested by the team! `develop` will likely end up being 50 commits ahead of main and that's totally normal. When our future teammates pull from the `main` branch, we want them to pull rock solid, reliable code.
